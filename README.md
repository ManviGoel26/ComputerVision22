# Computer Vision Assignments
Assignments for the course Computer Vision (CSE344) IIIT Delhi Winter 22

## Assignments
### Assignment 1. 
* Implement Equations 3 & 5 of [Global Contrast Based Salient Region Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6871397) on the k-means clustered image (k=85) of the input image.
* Implement a variant of Otsu's algorithm minimizing the sum of total sum of squares. 
* Develop a tight bounding circle (red-colored) around the person in the input video.

### Assignment 2.
* Develop the saliency quality measurement system as described in the Section III-B of [Quality-Guided Fusion-Based Co-Saliency Estimation for Image Co-Segmentation and Colocalization](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8269367).
* Modify the way of LBP and use SPP method for feature aggregation to compute image-level features for images in the dataset. Use these image-level features to group them into k-groups using fuzzy c-means clustering.
* Develop a BoW model of k words using HoG features.
* Develop a system to search for k-nearest images in a dataset for a search image using Shi-Thomsi corners and LBP patch-level features around the corners detected.

### Assignment 3.
* Use SLIC super-pixels to compute the saliency map of the given input image using the given formula.
* Perform region-level segmentation using DBSCAN clustering algorithm for the given input image.

## Instructions
* For each assignment, the detailed instructions to run the code files are given in *Report.pdf* along with input and output details.
* The input and output files are also given inside each folder.
* Detailed instructions for the assignment are also given inside the folder as *Assignment1/2/3*.
